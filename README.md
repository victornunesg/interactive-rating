## About the project

This is a challenge from the FrontEnd Challenge website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). The objective is to build an interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

To do this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
